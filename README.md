Where At?
=========

[Where At?](http://where.kim) is a simple tool for annotating, sharing, and collaborating on maps.

## Drawing

![tools](http://where.kim/images/tools.png "The Drawing Tools")

Select either the line-drawing or marker-placing tool at the top left, then touch the map to draw a line or place a marker.

## Sharing

When you're done, you can click "Save" at the bottom to share your map. Your map will be given a unique URL, which you can send to anyone you'd like.

## Collaborating

Because maps can be re-saved, it's possible to make collaborative maps. Make a map, save it, and pass along the URL. Anyone else can then add their own annotations and resave the map.

### Examples

*	[Some places I have lived](http://www.where.kim/map/7)

*	[Directions to my apartment](http://www.where.kim/map/6)

*	[Map of SAIC students' homes](http://www.where.kim/map/8)

### Tips

*	When using the line tool, double-click to end your current line.

*	You can still use gestures, like pinch-to-zoom and three-finger-drag to navigate the map, even while in the middle of drawing a line.
