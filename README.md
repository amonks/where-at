Where At?

## Collaborative Mapping

You can use the drawing tools at the top left to draw on the map. When you're done, you can save your map with the 'save' button on the bottom left, and share it with your buddies.

### Examples

*	[Directions to my apartment](http://www.where.kim/map/6)

*	[Some places I have lived](http://www.where.kim/map/7)

### Tips

*	When using the line tool, double-click to end your current line.

*	You can still use gestures, like pinch-to-zoom and three-finger-drag to navigate the map, even while in the middle of drawing a line.
